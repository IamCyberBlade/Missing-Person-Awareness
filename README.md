In this project I created a website linked to a database that allows users to input and view missing people cases. The aim of this project is to give individuals an alternative platform to help solve missing people cases. Depending on what area you live in, you can get an alert to look out for a missing person in your area with an accompanied image. Attached is the poster I used to promote the project.
